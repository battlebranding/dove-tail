						<p>I was bullied so badly I developed low self-esteem. No self-confidence caused me to walk with my head held down, body slouched with my neck facing forward. I was constantly getting in fights and picked on because I had dark skin, I was tall, I wore glasses, and I had big teeth. I got my glasses pulled off, was teased mercilessly, and called black bone and ugly simply because children can be so cruel. I carried the lack of self-confidence,</p>

						<p>low self-esteem  for  many years. I tried to commit suicide multiple times. I masked the fears I harbored and the internal struggles I battled through adolescence and well into adulthood. There was a plan and an actual reason why I had to struggle through my pain. Through it, I realized my past didn’t define me, it only directed me straight into my destiny. I understood that everything I endured wasn’t just for me, it was to be used to help someone else.</p>

					<p>Dina Knight Nelson is a North Carolina native, who has been making waves with her passion for inspiring and uplifting others. Motivational Speaker, Minister, Model, soon to be Author and Founder of Chosen for Destiny®, are just a few of the titles. She is the founder of Chosen for Destiny® which is an organization to inspire women of all ages to live on purpose, offering opportunities for weekly girl talks with adolescents in local communities to share lectures of beauty, confidence, self-worth, bully, relationships and etiquettes and most of all, embracing and loving yourself. Her own personal story is true proof that success is not about resources. It is about being creative, open to change, faithful, resourceful, accountable and responsible. Dina has hosted Vision board parties welcoming men and women where they put their life goals into a visual concept to be able to remind themselves of where they are and where they want to be, along with showing them the tools on how to make those dreams become realities.  Overcoming internal and external tribulations, her own personal story has endowed her with the strength to be able to uplift others to reach their own personal victories. Her format of facing your fears head on, embracing your past, dealing with hurt and let downs head on, and envisioning your future has become a standard in her teachings and speeches. She tells those with open eyes, open hearts, and open minds, “Everything we go through is for someone else and we overcome by the words from our testimonies.”</p>
